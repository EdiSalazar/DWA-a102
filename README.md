# DWA-a102
In the present work, a hydrological model based on regression equations proposed by the German techinical guideline DWA-A102 is implemented. It is a simple model and requires a limited amount of input data. The programm provides climatic data of reference (P, ETP) for 58 cities of Germany. That data can be used as input, in case that the user does not have a more recent/accurate data.
