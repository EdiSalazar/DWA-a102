# DWA-a102
In the present work, a hydrological model based on regression equations proposed by the German techinical guideline DWA-A102 is implemented. It is a simple model and requires a limited amount of input data. The programm provides climatic data of reference (P, ETP) for 58 cities of Germany. That data can be used as input, in case that the user does not have a more recent/accurate data.

Important!!!

All the relevant method to apply the water balance can be found in the file dwa_a102.py
The additional python files contain functions that are required by dwa_a102.py.
